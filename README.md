# Mini data analysis

This repository contains files related to a mini data analysis for STAT 545 at UBC. At the time of this course, the milestone assignments could be found at https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/

This data analysis is based on exploring the accessibility of apartment buildings in Toronto. The purpose of this analysis is to get comfortable with performing reproducible data analyses using R and Github.

## Files

All files in this analysis can be segmented into three milestones, completed sequentially. These milestones have separate tagged releases, labelled m1, m2, and m3.

### Milestone 1

The first part of the data analysis, including selection of the dataset and preliminary exploration of this data. This milestone also includes the research questions. This milestone was due 9 October 2021.

*  **milestone_1**  The anlaysis (.Rmd) and output (.md) for this milestone.
*  **milestone_1_files** A directory containing the figures that are embedded in milestone 1 .md file.

### Milestone 2

The second part of the data analysis, which focused on summarising and graphing the Toronto apartment building dataset. This milestone was due 19 October 2021.

*  **milestone_2** The anlaysis (.Rmd) and output (.md) for this milestone.
*  **milestone_2_files** A directory containing the figures that are embedded in milestone 2 .md file.


### Milestone 3

The third and final part of the data analysis, which focused on model building and data I/O. This milestone was due 28 October 2021.

*  **milestone_3** The anlaysis (.Rmd) and output (.md) for this milestone.
*  **milestone_3_files** A directory containing the figures that are embedded in milestone 2 .md file.
*  **output** The folder with output summary tables and models from the **milestone_3** analysis step.
